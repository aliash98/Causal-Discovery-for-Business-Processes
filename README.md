Data-Driven Decision Support for Business
Processes: Causal Reasoning and Discovery

Abstract:
Various types of decisions influence the execution of a busi- MW, update once
intro is doneness process, e.g., in terms of control-flow and resource assignments. Data
recorded during process execution can be used to identify which decisions
are informed by data and by previous decisions, to predict their outcome,
and to guide interventions as part of a what-if analysis. The latter requires
causal models that explain decisions. Yet, existing causal techniques for
business processes are limited: they focus on control-flow decisions only,
ignore confounding variables, and use ad-hoc methods to resolve causal
conflicts. In this paper, we fill this gap, by introducing a business pro-
cess causal decision model (BP-CDM) that generalizes existing models
for decision support. It incorporates data variables, which uncover con-
founding effects, and capture resource decisions. Moreover, we provide
a general causal discovery algorithm, based on the notion of temporal
tiers, that takes process precedence into account, without the need for
ad-hoc conflict resolution mechanisms. We demonstrate the usefulness of
our approach through experiments with synthetically generated datasets.
